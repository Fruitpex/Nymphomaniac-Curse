Your journey starts at the local towns Bazaar.&#39;&#39;

Sally is an ordinary girl that lives on her farm. Today is the day you set out to journey to another town- a few miles away. Before you embark on your short journey- you decide to head to the local market for some produce. As you pass a couple of market stalls, you stop and gaze at some fruit. 

Your eyes gaze upon some Peaches, Bannana&#39;s, Oranges, and Apples.

&#39;&#39;You decide to cut off two of the options to make the decision easier.&#39;&#39;

The lesbian witch casted a dark spell on one of the apples. The apple is bright red, almost shining inside the market basket. Only a beautiful girl can spot and pick out this apple. The unlucky beautiful girl who spots the apple would feel a deep desire to pick out and buy the apple, because it would look too delicious to ignore.

//Sally: “I would like to buy some apples, please”
Shop Lady: “ That will be 3 coppers, dearie.
Sally: “ Here you go, ma’m!”//

Once consumed, it will immediately cast the horrifying curse onto her! 

What kind of curses will befall our poor soul? Terrible things! Horrifying and unimaginable things. One bite of this cursed apple and all of it&#39;s evil magic effects will be casted.

&#39;&#39;The evil lesbian witch made sure that the one who bites into &#39;her apple&#39; will seek out her ‘mistress.’ to serve her true purpose. 

This is a story of Darkness, Corruption, Voyeurism, Lesbian Magic, Romance&#39;&#39;
